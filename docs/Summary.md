# Why Proxima?


Proxima creates a simple client interface to seamlessly access data from a variety of blockchains without a trusted 3rd party or secondary consensus mechanism.
In order to improve the developer experience we have created a client that can interact with each dataset, which means less time learning
 APIs and SDKs, and more time working on your project.
